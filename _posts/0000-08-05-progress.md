Notes:

OK, so presumably the big question you are asking now is — does it work?

The answer I have is: I don't know. My son started using the app just before he turned 6 years old, and he's been doing it for about 10 months now. He has mastered 8 chords and as you can see he's making slow and steady progress towards the final white key chord.

Notes:

I know of one other person using the app, and weirdly she actually started the method *before* the app was developed, so she's a bit ahead of my son. Her dad says she's not perfect on individual note identification yet, but as you can see she seems to be doing pretty well to me.
