Notes:

To put everyone on the same page, most people have what's called relative pitch — you can tell if one sound is higher or lower than another sound, but you cannot hear a sound and say, "Oh, that's a middle C" without a known reference pitch — that is why, for example, the stereotypical barbershop quartet will have someone blowing into a pitch pipe before they start singing — they know what note that's supposed to be, and they know where they should be singing relative to it.

In contrast, absolute pitch (also sometimes called perfect pitch), is when you can identify notes without the nee
d of a reference pitch.

To visually demonstrate this, you can see if you look at these three waveforms at the top, it's pretty easy to see which ones are higher and lower frequency than the others, but it would be pretty difficult to estimate the actual frequencies at a glance, but if you were to plot in the fourier domain, you can pretty easily see what frequency each one is just by looking at it.

In some ways I've heard absolute pitch described as perceiving sound more like the way most of us perceive color — you can look at a color and know that it's red or yellow or blue or something, you don't need to compare objects to swatches to determine how red or blue they are, you just look at it and know what color it is.

# Teaching Absolute Pitch to Children

<!--
     alt="A screenshot of the abstract of a paper in Psychology of Music from 2012. The title is: A longitudinal study of the process of acquiring absolute pitch: A practical report of training with the ‘chord identification method’

The author is Ayako Sakakibara from the Ichionkai Music School, Tokyo, Japan

The abstract is:

The purpose of this study was to investigate longitudinally the process of acquiring absolute pitch (AP). Twenty-four young children (aged 2 to 6 years) without AP were trained to acquire AP using Eguchi’s (1991) Chord Identification Method (CIM). All children were able to acquire AP (except two who ceased training). Results suggest that, at a minimum, children younger than 6 years old are capable of acquiring AP through intentional training. Furthermore, children’s errors observed during training suggested the transition of different strategies relying respectively on tone height and tone chroma. Initially, children identified chords using a strategy depending primarily on tone height, then gradually they began to attend to tone chroma to identify chords and this process ultimately led to acquisition of AP.">

Notes:

I knew about perfect pitch and thought it might be cool to have, but I had always been under the impression that it was not something you could learn — either your brain processes sound this way or it doesn't. But then I came across a paper from 2012 claiming that with enough training, it is possible to acquire absolute pitch in childhood. It comes from a school in Japan called the Ichionkai Music School, and they claim to have a 90% success rate using their method to train children between ages 2 and 6, and conveniently they lay out the method in the paper.

## Reasons for Skepticism

- Baseline credence for psychology research should be extremely low
- Study was performed by the Ichionkai Music School
- The dropout rate was ridiculously low for this method

## Reasons to Try Anyway

- Probably no one is really trying to teach kids perfect pitch
- Critical period effects are probably real
- Total time commitment isn't high (though distributed in an annoying way)
    - ~75-150 hours over 1-2 years
- It can be a bonding experience

Notes:

There are some reasons to be skeptical of these claims. For one thing, after the advent of the reproducibility crisis — which I strongly suggest you look up if you don't already know about it — we should probably be pretty skeptical of *any* studies, much less non-preregistered accounts coming from a music school that sells books teaching the method.

- One thing that is very fishy about the study to me is that in the paper they say that they recruited 24 students and told the parents that they could stop at any time, then taught them the method and followed their progress. They claim that 2 students dropped out, and the remaining 22 *all* acquired absolute pitch. This seems like a much bigger effect size than I would expect for something where the common wisdom is that it's impossible.

- This method, as you will soon see, involves quizzing 2-6 year olds *five times a day* for *several years*. I would submit that getting a 2-6 year old to do *anything* even *once a day* is a challenge. Unless Japanese culture and patterns of life are *very different* around young children than they are here, I would not expect a 90% compliance rate on an invention asking parents to brush their childrens' teeth in the morning and night, so 5 daily practices strains credibility.

That said, it's not impossible that this is just an understudied area, and that no one has really tried this kind of intervention before. And critical periods — where it's easier to do something during a certain part of your life and not in others — are probably a real effect.

At the end of the day, the reason I decided to go for it was that I thought it might be a fun thing to do with my children, and despite being distributed in an annoying way, the overall time commitment is not especially high.
