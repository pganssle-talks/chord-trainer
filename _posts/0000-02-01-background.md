# Relative and Absolute Pitch

Notes:

OK, so if you don't know, absolute pitch or perfect pitch is basically the ability to hear a note and know what note it is without reference to another pitch. Most people have relative pitch, where we can only tell if one note is higher than another, but not what they are absolutely. My understanding is that people with absolute pitch experience sound the way most of us experience color — if you only had 'relative color', you couldn't look at an object and determine that it is red, but you'd be able to know if it is more or less red than another object.

# Teaching Absolute Pitch to Children

     alt="A screenshot of the abstract of a paper in Psychology of Music from 2012. The title is: A longitudinal study of the process of acquiring absolute pitch: A practical report of training with the ‘chord identification method’

The author is Ayako Sakakibara from the Ichionkai Music School, Tokyo, Japan

The abstract is:

The purpose of this study was to investigate longitudinally the process of acquiring absolute pitch (AP). Twenty-four young children (aged 2 to 6 years) without AP were trained to acquire AP using Eguchi’s (1991) Chord Identification Method (CIM). All children were able to acquire AP (except two who ceased training). Results suggest that, at a minimum, children younger than 6 years old are capable of acquiring AP through intentional training. Furthermore, children’s errors observed during training suggested the transition of different strategies relying respectively on tone height and tone chroma. Initially, children identified chords using a strategy depending primarily on tone height, then gradually they began to attend to tone chroma to identify chords and this process ultimately led to acquisition of AP.">

Notes:

I always thought it would be cool to have perfect pithc, but I had been under the impression that it was not something you could learn — either your brain processes sound this way or it doesn't. But then I came across a paper from 2012 claiming that with enough training, it is possible to acquire absolute pitch in childhood. It comes from a school in Japan called the Ichionkai Music School, and they claim to have a 90% success rate using their method to train children between ages 2 and 6, and conveniently they lay out the method in the paper.

## Reasons for Skepticism

- Baseline credence for psychology research should be extremely low
- Study was performed by the Ichionkai Music School
- The dropout rate was ridiculously low for this method

## Reasons to Try Anyway

- Probably no one is really trying to teach kids perfect pitch
- Critical period effects are probably real
- Total time commitment isn't high (though distributed in an annoying way)
    - ~75-150 hours over 1-2 years
- It can be a bonding experience

Notes:

There are some reasons to be skeptical of these claims. For one thing, after the advent of the reproducibility crisis — which I strongly suggest you look up if you don't already know about it — we should probably be pretty skeptical of *any* studies, much less non-preregistered accounts coming from a music school that sells books teaching the method.

- To me, though, the fishiest thing about the study is the dropout rate; this method, as you will soon see, involves quizzing 2-6 year olds *five times a day* for *several years*. I would submit that getting a 2-6 year old to do *anything* even *once a day* is a challenge. Unless Japanese culture and patterns of life are *very different* around young children than they are here, I would not expect a 90% compliance rate on an invention asking parents to brush their childrens' teeth in the morning and night, so 5 daily practices strains credibility.

- That said, I don't think there's been a ton of research either way, and critical effects *probably* are real, and I felt that the investment of time wasn't so high that it might not be worth trying out. Plus it actually has turned out to be a fun bonding experience between my son and I.
